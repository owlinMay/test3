Abstract

摘要

This paper aims to balance the conceptual reception of Bourdieu,s sociology in the United States through a conceptual re-examination of the concept of Habitus. I retrace the intellectual lineage of the Habitus idea, showing it to have roots in Claude Levi-Strauss structural anthropology and in the developmental psychology of Jean Piaget, especially the latter,s generalization of the idea of operations from mathematics to the study of practical, bodily-mediated cognition. One important payoff of this exercise is that the common misinterpretation of the Habitus as an objectivist and reductionist element in Bourdieu,s thought is dispelled. The Habitus is shown to be instead a useful and flexible way to conceptualize agency and the ability to transform social structure. Thus ultimately one of Bourdieu,s major contributions to social theory consists of his development of a new radical form of cognitive sociology, along with an innovative variety of multilevel sociological explanation in which the interplay of different structural orders is highlighted.

本文旨在通过对“惯习”概念的重新审视，来平衡布迪厄社会学在美国的概念接受。我追溯了惯习思想的思想渊源，发现它起源于克劳德 · 列维 · 斯特劳斯的结构人类学，起源于让 · 皮亚杰的发展心理学，特别是后者对运算思想的概括，从数学到实践的、以身体为中介的认知研究。这项工作的一个重要收获是，人们对惯习是 Bourdieu 思想中一个客观主义者和还原主义者的常见误解被消除了。相反，“惯习”被证明是一种有用和灵活的方式，可以将机构和转变社会结构的能力概念化。因此，布尔迪厄对社会理论的主要贡献之一就是他发展了一种新的激进的认知社会学形式，并创造性地提出了多层次的社会学解释，突出了不同结构秩序之间的相互作用。

In keeping with the usual vi^^, the goal of sociology is to uncover the most deeply buried structures of the different social worlds that make up the social universe, as well as the 'mechanisms' that tend to ensure their reproduction or transformation. Merging with psychology, though with a kind of psychology undoubtedly quite different from the most widely accepted image of this science, such an exploration of the cognitive structures that agents bring to bear in their practical knowledge of the social worlds thus structured. Indeed there exists a correspondence between social structures and mental structures, between the objective divisions of the social world... and the principles of vision and division that agents apply to them. (Bourdieu, 1996b [1989], p. 1).

社会学的目标是揭示构成社会宇宙的不同社会世界最深层的结构，以及确保它们复制或转化的机制。与心理学相结合，虽然与一种心理学无疑完全不同于这门科学最广为接受的形象，这种探索的认知结构，代理人带来承担他们的实际知识的社会世界，因此结构。事实上，在社会结构和心理结构之间，在社会世界的客观划分之间... ... 和代理人应用于它们的远见和划分原则之间，存在着一种对应关系。(布迪厄，1996 b [1989] ，第1页)。

Introduction

引言

While most English-speaking sociologists acknowledge that the legacy left behind by Pierre Bourdieu represents a towering accomplishment in contemporary social theory and research, the impact and dissemination of his writings in the Anglophone academy continues to be rather uneven and selective (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1996; Wacquant, 1993). It is fair to say that the now flourishing industry that has grown around Bourdieu,s work in English is the most successful appropriation of "French Theory" by mainstream American and British social science (Swartz, 2003), and not simply the latest case of the "French flu" as Bourdieu feared (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1997). However, few have noticed how the wa^y in which this incorporation has been carried out has been essentially molded to suit the theoretical and epistemological tastes of the Anglophone (and especially American) sociological establishment (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1996; Wacquant, 1993).

虽然大多数说英语的社会学家承认皮埃尔 · 布尔迪厄留下的遗产代表了当代社会理论和研究的一项杰出成就，但他的著作在英语学院的影响和传播仍然是不均衡和有选择性的(布尔迪厄和 Wacquant，1996年; Wacquant，1993年)。公平地说，围绕布迪厄的英语著作而发展起来的现在蓬勃发展的工业是美国和英国主流社会科学对“法国理论”最成功的挪用(Swartz，2003) ，而不仅仅是布迪厄担心的“法国流感”的最新案例(Bourdieu and Wacquant，1997)。然而，很少有人注意到这种融合是如何从本质上被塑造成适合英语国家(特别是美国)社会学机构的理论和认识论品味(布迪厄和瓦夸特，1996; 瓦夸特，1993)。

In the case of the U.S., Bourdieu is seen primarily as a theorist of cultural and symbolic stratification, concerned for the most part with a contemporary revision of the Weberian concept of class as lifestyle subcultures that attempt to sustain status through strategies of social closure (Brubaker, 1985; Murphy, 1983). Recent empirical research on the sociology of culture has been predominantly concerned with Bourdieu,s theory of taste and consumption and with his development of the concept of "cultural capital" (Bryson, 1996, 1997; Holt, 1998, 1997;

以美国为例，布迪厄主要被视为一个文化和象征性分层的理论家，在很大程度上关注当代修正的韦伯阶层作为生活方式亚文化的概念，试图通过社会封闭战略来维持地位(布鲁贝克，1985; 墨菲，1983)。最近的实证研究文化社会学主要关注布迪厄的品味和消费理论，以及他对“文化资本”概念的发展(Bryson，1996,1997; Holt，1998,1997;

DiMaggio, 1982; DiMaggio and Mohr, 1985; Lamont, 1992, Lamont and Lareau, 1988; Lizardo, 2004), an idea that has also had a deep impact on American and British studies of education and stratification (i.e. Dumais, 2002; Lareau, 2003; Nash, 2003). In a similar way, recent commentary and interpretations of Bourdieu,s work in media studies, have concentrated their attention on Bourdieu,s field theory of cultural production (Benson, 1997), and his mesolovel sociological account of the interaction symbolic production fields and the "field of power", or the state (Couldry, 2003). In England, on the other hand, the focus has been on Bourdieu as a sociologist of education (Nash, 1990), especially in regard to his early studies in the sociology of language and the educational field (Bourdieu, 1967a; Bourdieu and Passeron, 1977), and consequently his work was initially thought of as belonging to the same lineage as the tradition of critical sociology of education popularized by Basil Bernstein. Thus the majority of British commentary on Bourdieu consisted on the adequacy of his views of the educational system as an element of class reproduction (Nash, 2003, 1999; Harker, 1984), including comparisons with Bernstein,s formulations (Collins, 2000; Harker and May, 1993). Lately with the rise in interest in culture and consumption in British shores, interest in Bourdieu,s work in England has begun to synchronize itself to the earlier incorporation of Bourdieu in the U.S. (Warde, Martens and Olsen, 1999; Warde and Tampubolon, 2002; Warde, Tomlinson and McMeekin, 2000).

迪马乔，1982年; 迪马乔和莫尔，1985年; 拉蒙特，1992年，拉蒙特和拉罗，1988年; 利扎尔多，2004年) ，这个想法也对美国和英国的教育和分层研究产生了深远的影响(即杜马斯，2002年; 拉罗，2003年; 纳什，2003年)。同样，近年来对布迪厄的媒介研究工作的评论和解释，也集中在布迪厄的文化生产场理论(Benson，1997)和他的符号生产场与“权力场”或国家的相互作用的系列小说社会学解释(Couldry，2003)上。另一方面，在英格兰，人们关注的焦点是作为教育社会学家的布尔迪厄(Nash，1990) ，特别是他早期的语言社会学和教育领域的研究(Bourdieu，1967a; Bourdieu 和 Passeron，1977) ，因此他的作品最初被认为与巴兹尔 · 伯恩斯坦流行的批判性教育社会学的传统属于同一支系。因此，大多数英国对布迪厄的评论都是基于他对教育系统作为阶级再生产要素的观点(纳什，2003年，1999年; 哈克，1984年) ，包括与伯恩斯坦公式的比较(柯林斯，2000年; 哈克和梅，1993年)。最近，随着英国海岸对文化和消费兴趣的增加，人们对 Bourdieu 作品的兴趣开始与布尔迪厄早期在美国的合并同步起来(Warde，Martens and Olsen，1999; Warde and tampuboon，2002; Warde，Tomlinson and McMeekin，2000)。

What all of these appropriations of Bourdieu,s work have in common, is that they concentrate on Bourdieu as primarily a macrostructural conflict theorist, who has been able to deploy certain strands of Durkhemian and Weberian theory in order to develop a species of —generalized materialism" (Bourdieu, 1990a; Vanderberghe, 1999) as an alternative to moribund Marxist class analysis (Grusky and Sorensen, 1998). This focus on Bourdieu as essentially a theorist of class has brought with it a subsequent hyper-emphasis on the more "mesolevel" aspects of Bourdieu,s Bourdieu,s work, especially his theory of fields (Bourdieu, 1985a; Martin, 2003), and forms of capital (Calhoun, 1993, LiPuma, 1993), but has resulted in the theoretical neglect and denigration of the final member of this triad: the idea of the habitus.

所有这些对布迪厄著作的拨款的共同之处在于，它们主要集中于布迪厄作为一个宏观结构冲突理论家，他能够运用 Durkhemian 和韦伯的某些理论来发展一种ーー广义唯物主义”(布迪厄，1990年; 范德伯格，1999年) ，作为马克思主义阶级分析的替代(格鲁斯基和索伦森，1998年)。这种对布迪厄作为阶级理论家本质的关注随之带来了对布迪厄作品中更多的“中观层面”的强调，特别是他的场论(布迪厄，1985a; 马丁，2003)和资本形式(卡尔霍恩，1993，利普马，1993) ，但导致了对这个三位一体的最后一个成员: 惯习的理念的理论忽视和诋毁。

In this paper I attempt to reconstruct the intellectual origins of the idea of habitus. Through this conceptual archeology I aim to establish three central set of points: First, the habitus has its origins in a creative blend of concepts originating in the proto-structural anthropology of Durkheim and Mauss, the post-Sausserian structural anthropology of Levi-Strauss and in the psychological genetic structuralism of Jean Piaget.[1](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark1) As opposed to being Bourdieu,s version of practical "agency" counterposed to an overarching structural field (King, 2000), the habitus is itself a generative dynamic structure that adapts and accommodates itself to another dynamic mesolevel structure composed primarily of other actors, situated practices and durable institutions (fields).

本文试图重构“惯习”思想的思想渊源。通过这个概念考古学，我的目标是建立三个中心点: 第一，惯习起源于一个创造性的概念混合，起源于涂尔干和毛斯的原结构人类学，列维-斯特劳斯的后索塞尔结构人类学和心理遗传结构主义让皮亚杰。

Second, the habitus is an important theoretical object insofar as it saves Bourdieu's theory from becoming a pure rationalist positional formalism with disembodied agents embedded in fields and engaging in strategies to accumulate different kinds of capital (such as the theoretical stances proposed by Anglo-Saxon rational actor-oriented network theorists such as Coleman, 1990 and Burt, 1982, 1992; and sometimes attached to Bourdieu himself), and allows Bourdieu to analyze the social agent as a physical, embodied actor, subject to developmental, cognitive and emotive constraints and affected by the very real physical and institutional configurations of the field.

其次，惯习是一个重要的理论对象，因为它使布迪厄的理论免于成为一个纯粹的理性主义的位置形式主义，其中脱离实体的个体嵌入领域，并参与策略，以积累不同类型的资本(如由盎格鲁理性撒克逊行为者导向的网络理论家提出的理论立场，如科尔曼，1990年和伯特，1982年，1992年，有时附属于布迪厄本人) ，并允许布迪厄分析社会行为者作为一个物理的，行为者，受发展，认知和情绪的约束，并受到非常现实的物理和制度的场配置的影响。

Third, a detour into the intellectual origins of the habitus allows us to appreciate Bourdieu's development of a new style of sociological analysis, one that I deem to be a creative cognitive sociology (Zerubavel, 1997) that takes seriously the historical development of schemata of perception, classification and action that are ultimately responsible for both macrostructural social reproduction and change. Here I delve in some detail on the little recognized influence of Jean Piaget on Bourdieu's thinking. I argue that a lot of the conceptual and definitional apparatus of the habitus can be traced back to Piaget's unique blend of structuralism and developmental cognitive psychology, especially his generalization of the idea of operations from the mathematics of group theory and formal logic to the understanding cognition and practical bodily action (Piaget, 1970a).[2](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark2) While Piaget has been a rather neglected figure in contemporary social thought (Kitchener, 1991), drawing the connection between him and Bourdieu, allows us to appreciate the true multidimensionality in Bourdieu,s thinking and simultaneously begin to recognize Piaget,s heretofore ignored contributions to social theory.

第三，迂回到惯习的思想起源，让我们欣赏布尔迪厄发展出的一种新的社会学分析方式，我认为这是一种创造性的认知社会学(Zerubavel，1997) ，它认真对待感知、分类和行为图式的历史发展，这些图式最终负责宏观结构的社会再生产和变化。在这里，我深入研究了让 · 皮亚杰对布迪厄思想的影响。皮亚杰是当代社会思想中一个相当被忽视的人物(基奇纳，1991) ，通过描绘他和布迪厄之间的联系，我们可以欣赏到 Bourdieu 思想中真正的多维性，同时也开始认识到皮亚杰对社会理论迄今为止所忽视的贡献。

Now I move to the task at hand: first I discuss Bourdieu,s initial definition of the concept of habitus and show how the incipient cognitive sociology derived from a reconstruction of Levi-Straussian structuralism and a concerted engagement with Piaget,s genetic version of structuralism can be observed at that stage. I discuss how the concept of bodily operations and bodily schemas are one of the primary foundations of the habitus, and connect those ideas with Bourdieu,s theory of social reproduction. I then go on to review the Piagetian conception of practical action and knowledge acquisition, and show how his conceptual apparatus constitute the primary building blocks of the habitus. I then further develop the argument that tries to establish the usefulness of construing Bourdieu,s work as a structural cognitive sociology. Throughout, I demonstrate Bourdieu,s usage of this cognitive approach to sociological analysis by drawing examples from his work on aesthetic perception and appreciation and his anthropology of Kabyle society.

现在，我开始进入手头的工作: 首先，我讨论布迪厄对惯习概念的最初定义，并说明早期认知社会学是如何从莱维-斯特劳斯结构主义的重建和皮亚杰结构主义的发生学版本中派生出来的。我讨论了身体操作和身体图式的概念是如何成为习惯的主要基础之一的，并将这些概念与布迪厄的社会再生产理论联系起来。然后我继续回顾皮亚杰学派关于实际行动和知识获取的概念，并展示他的概念机制是如何构成习性的基本构件的。然后进一步发展论证，试图确立布迪厄著作作为结构认知社会学的有用性。在整个过程中，我通过引用布尔迪厄的美学知觉和欣赏作品以及他的 Kabyle 社会人类学作品中的例子，论证了布尔迪厄运用这种认知方法进行社会学分析。

Unpacking the Habitus: The Origins of Bourdieu’s Cognitive Sociology

揭开惯习: 布迪厄认知社会学的渊源

### DEFINING THE HABITUS 定义惯习

Bourdieu,s basic concern, as far back as his classic essay Intellectual Field and Creative Project (Bourdieu, 1968; [French Original, 1966]) has been not only with the synchronic, crosssectional explanation of particular variations in social morphology (the structure of fields), but also with the diachronic emphasis on the process of reproduction of class structures and fields of intellectual and/or economic striving (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992). The concept that Bourdieu proposed in order to connect his depiction of systemic structuration and his accounts of individual action is of course, that of habitus (King, 2000). While Anglophone commentators feel comfortable either accepting or debating most aspects of Bourdieu,s Sociology, their cozy disposition quickly terminates when confronted with the idea of habitus (c.f. Alexander, 1995). From its initial formulation (and early definition can be found in Bourdieu, 1968), the habitus has always seemed like a mysterious entity able to do lots of conceptual and theoretical work. In the words of Paul DiMaggio (1979), the habitus appears to be a "kind of theoretical deus ex machind，. Lest we forget the daunting complexity of the concept with which we are faced, here is one of Bourdieu,s (1968: xx) earliest definitions of habitus once again:

布迪厄的基本观点，早在他的经典散文《知识领域与创造性工程》(布迪厄，1968; [法文原著，1966])中，就不仅对社会形态(领域结构)的特殊变化进行了共时的、跨领域的解释，而且对阶级结构和知识和/或经济努力领域的再现过程进行了历时性的强调(布迪厄与瓦昆，1992)。布迪厄为了把他对系统结构化的描述和他对个人行为的描述联系起来而提出的概念当然是惯习的概念(金，2000)。讲英语的评论员对于接受或辩论 Bourdieu 社会学的大部分方面感到舒适，但是当他们遇到习惯的想法时，他们舒适的性格很快就消失了(c.f. 亚历山大1995)。从最初的表述(早期的定义可以在1968年的 Bourdieu 找到) ，惯习似乎总是像一个神秘的实体，能够做大量的概念和理论工作。用保罗 · 迪马吉奥(1979)的话来说，惯习似乎是一种“理论上的救世主”。为了避免我们忘记我们所面临的这个令人生畏的复杂概念，下面是布尔迪厄(1968: xx)对习性最早的定义之一:

A system of lasting, transposable dispositions which, integrating past experiences, functions at every moment as a matrix of perceptions, appreciations, and actions and makes possible the achievement of infinitely diversified tasks, thanks to analogical transfers of schemes permitting the solution of similarly shaped problems.[3](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark4)

一个持久的、可转换的处置系统，它整合过去的经验，每时每刻都作为一个感知、欣赏和行动的矩阵，通过类比的方案转移，使得能够实现无限多样化的任务，从而能够解决类似形状的问题

Later on, in Outline of a Theory of Practice (1977: p. 72), Bourdieu offers an account of both the origins and of, and a revised rendering of habitus:

后来，在《实践理论纲要》(1977:72)中，布迪厄提供了一个关于惯习的起源和修订的解释:

The structures constitutive of a particular type of environment ... produce habitus, systems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles of the generation and structuring of practices and representations.... [T]he practices produced by the

构成特定类型环境的结构... 产生习性，系统的持久，转位置，结构化结构倾向于作为结构化结构的功能，也就是说，作为原则的生成和结构的实践和表现... [ t ] he 实践产生的

habitus [are] the strategy-generating principle enabling agents to cope with unforeseen and ever-changing situations.

惯习是产生策略的原则，使行动者能够应付不可预见和不断变化的情况。

A more recent definition of habitus and presumably one of Bourdieu,s last and most definitive statements on the subject can be found in The Logic qf Practice (1990, p. 53):

惯习的一个更新的定义，可能是布迪厄关于这个主题的最后和最明确的陈述之一，可以在《逻辑 qf 实践》(1990年，第53页)中找到:

Systems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them. Objectively 'regulated‘ and 'regular‘ without being in any way the product of obedience to rules, they can be collectively orchestrated without being the product of the organizing action of a conductor.

持久的、可转位的配置系统、倾向于作为结构结构发挥作用的结构化结构，也就是说，作为产生和组织实践和表述的原则，这些实践和表述可以客观地适应其结果，而不需要预先假定有意识地瞄准目的或明确掌握实现目的所必需的操作。客观上的“规范”和“规范”并不是遵守规则的产物，它们可以集体协调，而不是指挥者组织行为的产物。

While these particular definitions stand as a good example of the obscurantism that 22 years ago DiMaggio thought might have prevented the acceptance of Bourdieu in Anglophone sociological circles, we can surely say that DiMaggio's concerns were correct in the sense that this conceptual density definitely prevented a full acceptance and more complete engagement Bourdieu's conceptual system. Thus, while the reaction of many American sociologists when faced with this perplexing conceptualization of habitus is to dismiss it as a fuzzy idea or to treat it as under-specified and abstract, others worry that it harks back to the Parsonian "oversocialized" (Wrong, 1961) actor, and regard it as a foreign object in Bourdieu's overall theoretical scheme, deeply at odds with his otherwise purposive and agentic conceptualization of the social agent (Alexander, 1995; King, 2000; Lizardo, 2004). Nevertheless, few of Bourdieu's interpreters, whether it is appropriators or detractors, try to truly engage the concept of habitus, in what could be a potentially rewarding effort to disentangle its correct meaning and application with the expectation that it might illuminate current puzzles and problems in social theory and research.

虽然这些特殊的定义是蒙昧主义的一个很好的例子，22年前迪马乔认为可能阻止了 Bourdieu 在英语社会学界的接受，但我们可以肯定地说，迪马乔的关注是正确的，因为这种概念的密度肯定阻止了布尔迪厄的概念系统的完全接受和更完整的参与。因此，当许多美国社会学家面对这种令人费解的习性概念化时，他们的反应是把它当作一个模糊的概念而拒之门外，或者认为它是一个不够明确和抽象的概念，其他人则担心它会让人想起帕尔索主义的“过度社会化”(错误，1961年)的演员，并把它当作布尔迪厄整体理论框架中的一个外来物体，这与他对社会行为者的目的性和代理性的概念化(亚历山大，1995年; 金，2000年; 利扎尔多，2004年)有很大的不同。然而，很少有布迪厄的解释者---- 无论是批评者还是诋毁者---- 尝试真正地接触惯习的概念，这可能是一个潜在的有益的努力，以解析其正确的含义和应用，并期望它可以阐明当前的困惑和问题，在社会理论和研究。

As a corrective to this situation, I will attempt to get at the ideational origins of the habitus concept, and then will proceed with an analysis of its basic theoretical claims and implications. I distinguish between two major uses that Bourdieu made of the concept of habitus in his work: the habitus as a perceptual and classifying structure, and the habitus as a generative structure of practical action. I begin by briefly discussing the intellectual origins of the first classificatory notion of habitus, which continues to be the most widespread interpretation of the idea, but devote the bulk of my discussion to the latter facet, because it has been relatively neglected and when addressed, subject to persistent misinterpretations.

为了纠正这种情况，本文将试图回到“惯习”概念的概念起源上，并对其基本理论主张和意义进行分析。我区分了布迪厄在其著作中对惯习概念的两个主要用途: 作为感性和分类结构的惯习，以及作为实践行为生成结构的惯习。首先，我简要地讨论了惯习这一最早的分类概念的思想渊源，惯习仍然是对这一概念最广泛的解释，但我的大部分讨论都集中在后者方面，因为它相对而言被忽视了，一旦涉及，就会遭到持续的误解。

This first (classificatory) aspect of the habitus can be straightforwardly traced to Bourdieu,s intellectual debt to the long line of anthropological and sociological thinking stretching from Durkheim and Mauss to Levi-Strauss (Johnson, 1997).4 The second (practical not classificatory) side of the habitus is admittedly more difficult to connect to traditional social theory lineages. This had led most interpreters to point to Bourdieu,s notion of practical action as developing out of Merleau-Ponty‘s reflections on embodied consciousness, which constituted the latter,s own attempt to move beyond the disembodied solipsism of Husserl,s phenomenology. I contend, in contrast, that Bourdieu,s formulation of embodied practical action is not exclusively indebted to Merlau-Ponty or to the phenomenological tradition. In fact it can be shown that Bourdieu remained primarily indifferent and somewhat dismissive of phenomenology throughout his the course of his intellectual development (Throop and Murphy, 2002). This is evident in the critique of phenomenology offered in the introduction to The Logic Of Practice, where he chides the phenomenological account of experience for failing to go beyond a —...description of what specifically characterizes "lived[4](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark5) [5](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark6) experience of the social world, that is apprehension of the world as self evident, as "taken for granted'" (Bourdieu, 1990a: p. 25). What is missing in the phenomenological formulation? Precisely a consideration of the —conditions of possibility" (a nod to neo-Kantianism), "namely, the coincidence of the objective structures and internalized structures, [notice the reference to t^o types of structures] which produce the illusion of immediate understanding” (emphasis added). Further, the exclusive connection of Bourdieu,s theory of practice with Merlau-Ponty's embodied phenomenology has produced the mistaken notion that there exists a tension between Bourdieu's formulations of the habitus as an objective embodied structure and Bourdieu's theory of practical action.

这种惯习的第一个(分类)方面可以直接追溯到布尔迪厄的知识债务，从涂尔干和莫斯延伸到列维-施特劳斯(约翰逊，1997)。4惯习的第二个方面(实际而非分类) ，诚然更难与传统的社会理论谱系联系起来。这使得大多数解释者指出，布迪厄的实践行动概念是从梅洛-庞蒂对具身意识的思考发展而来的，这构成了后者自己超越胡塞尔现象学的非具身唯我论的尝试。相比之下，我认为布迪厄对具身实践行为的阐述并非完全归功于梅洛-庞蒂或现象学传统。事实上，可以看出，布迪厄在其整个思想发展过程中始终对现象学漠不关心，甚至有点不屑一顾(Throop and Murphy，2002)。这一点在《实践的逻辑》引言中提出的对现象学的批判中很明显，在那里，他责备对经验的现象学解释没有超越对“社会世界的生活5经验”的具体特征的描述，即对世界的理解是不言而喻的，被“认为是理所当然的”(布尔迪厄，1990年: 第25页)。在现象学的表述中缺少了什么？正是对可能性条件的思考”(对新康德主义的认可) ，“即客观结构与内化结构的巧合，[注意对结构类型的提及] ，产生了直接理解的幻觉”(强调后加)。此外，布迪厄的实践理论与梅洛-庞蒂的体验现象学的唯一联系导致了一种错误的观点，即布迪厄的体验结构的提法与布迪厄的实践行动理论之间存在着张力。

According to this interpretation, while Bourdieu's —practical theory” remains true to an agentic, purposive notion of action, his notion of habitus makes him fall into a determinist trap, where individuals are construed as the "puppets” of structure (King, 2000). However, this claim can only be sustained when the habitus is seen simply as a passive perceptual and classificatory faculty or when the embodied habitus is simply seen as the docile clay where society leaves its stamp (as in certain simplifications of Foucault's thinking), and not as an active generative matrix of action. I will put forth the counterclaim that Bourdieu's idea of practical action cannot be understood without rethinking the way that Bourdieu conceived of the notion of an embodied schema and the way that he deployed the concept of operations. I show how both concepts are derived from the genetic structuralism of Jean Piaget. Consequently, Bourdieu's characterization of the habitus is better understood as rooted in a (post-Kantian) neo-structuralism rather than on the neo-pragmatist grounds of the late Wittgenstein.

根据这种解释，虽然布迪厄的ー实践理论仍然忠实于一种主观的、目的性的行动概念，但他的惯性概念使他落入了决定论的陷阱，在那里个人被解释为结构的“木偶”(King，2000)。然而，只有当这种习性被简单地看作是一种被动的感知和分类能力，或者当具身的习性被简单地看作是社会留下印记的温顺粘土(就像福柯思想的某些简化) ，而不是作为行动的主动生成矩阵时，这种主张才能得到支持。我将提出反诉，认为如果不重新思考布尔迪厄构想具身图式概念的方式和他运用操作概念的方式，就无法理解布尔迪厄的实际行动理念。我展示了这两个概念是如何从皮亚杰的遗传结构主义派生出来的。因此，布迪厄的角色塑造更好地理解为植根于(后康德)新结构主义，而不是在新实用主义的基础上的后维特根斯坦。

For Bourdieu, a proper account of practice was not possible without paying attention to the very way in which practice was produced through structure and how by way of the habitus agents could use the products of (their own or others') practical action in their recursive attempt to reproduce larger structures (however, as I will argue later, this is not to be interpreted as a "structuration” formulation). Therefore, Bourdieu's thinking is not marked with an inherent tension between "acceptable” practice-theoretical formulations of action versus an "unacceptable” view of the objectivism of structure. In fact once the habitus is understood as an objective structure in itself (or as Bourdieu, referred to it, as the "objectivity of the subjective” [1990: p. 135]), we discover that there is no such tension in Bourdieu's thinking. While we can reject objectivism from some axiomatically hostile metatheoretical stance (neo-pragmatism, phenomenology, etc.), it is important to understand that within the parameters of his neostructuralist reconstruction of classic structuralism, Bourdieu did not fall into an incoherence trap, but that his attempt to produce an objective account of both practice and structure, without abandoning the basic framework of structuralist theory, but by modifying structuralism according to a generative and genetic metatheoretical stance, constituted the essence of his work (for a development of this line of argument and a reconsideration of Bourdieu as a generative structuralist and of the habitus as a cognitive structure capable of producing and sustaining institutional action, see Fararo and Butts, 1999).

对布迪厄来说，如果不注意实践是如何通过结构产生的，以及惯习行为者如何能够利用(他们自己或他人的)实践行为的产物来递归地试图复制更大的结构，就不可能对实践作出适当的解释(然而，正如我后面将要论述的那样，这不能被解释为”结构化”的表述)。因此，布迪厄的思想并没有在“可接受的”实践——行动的理论公式与结构的客观主义的“不可接受的”观点之间产生内在的张力。事实上，一旦惯习本身被理解为一种客观结构(或者用布迪厄的话来说，就是“主观的客观性”[1990: p. 135]) ，我们就会发现布迪厄的思想中并不存在这种张力。虽然我们可以拒绝客观主义的一些价值敌对的元理论立场(新实用主义，现象学等) ，但重要的是要理解，在他的新结构主义重建古典结构主义的参数，布尔迪厄没有陷入一个不一致的陷阱，但他的企图产生一个客观的叙述实践和结构，没有放弃基本框架的结构主义理论，但通过修改根据生成和发生元结构主义的立场，构成了他的工作的本质(关于这一论证路线的发展，以及对布迪厄作为生成结构主义者和惯习作为能够产生和维持机构行动的认知结构的重新考虑，见 Fararo 和 Butts，1999).

Seen in this vein, Bourdieu,s rejection of Levi-Straussian structuralism (Bourdieu, 1990a) and his career-long emphasis on both history and reflexivity (Bourdieu, 2000, 1990a; Bourdieu, and Wacquant, 1992) do not represent a "break” with structuralism and a turn to neo-pragmatist practice theory (Ortner, 1984), or to a neo-Husserlian "embodied” approach to phenomenology. Rather, Bourdieu remained a structuralist throughout, but his notion of structuralism was modified through the introduction of concerns regarding the genesis and the historical development of structure, as we will see below. In his mesolevel theory of structural change, Bourdieu of course made use of the field-theoretic metaphors derived from the social psychologist Kurt Lewin and the relational epistemology of Ernst Cassirer (Martin, 2003, Mohr, 2004, Vanderbergh, 1999), but at the level of individual action and cognition it was another psychologist (Piaget) who provided him with the tools of how to think of a conception of structure at a cognitive-practical level, that could serve as a matrix to generate action, but which did not involve the postulation of an ineffable consciousness from which "spontaneous” action originates (as in Mead, 1934).5

由此可见，布迪厄对列维-斯特劳斯结构主义(布迪厄，1990a)的拒绝，以及他一生对历史和反身性的强调(布迪厄，2000,1990a; 布迪厄，和 Wacquant，1992) ，并不代表与结构主义的“决裂”和对新实用主义实践理论的转向(奥特纳，1984) ，或对现象学的新胡塞尔式“体现”方法的转向。相反，布尔迪厄始终是一个结构主义者，但他的结构主义的概念是通过引入关注的起源和历史发展的结构，我们将在下面看到。在他的结构变化的细观层次理论中，布迪厄当然利用了来自社会心理学家库尔特 · 勒温和恩斯特 · 卡西尔的关系认识论的场论隐喻(Martin，2003，Mohr，2004，Vanderbergh，1999) ，但是在个体行为和认知层次上，是另一位心理学家(皮亚杰)为他提供了如何在认知-实践层次上思考概念结构的工具，它可以作为产生行动的矩阵，但是不涉及不可言喻的意识的后置，而这种意识正是“自发的”行动的起源(如米德1934)

Because of the usual conflation of the term "structure” with macro-level organization, the habitus is seldom viewed as a structure but is usually seen as a stand-in for the individual or subjective consciousness, which is then faced with a macrolevel structure composed of other individuals, institutions and organizations (King, 2000). However, if we recuperate the Piagetian notion of a psychological (cognitive) structure (Piaget, 1970a, 1970b) then we can appreciate the sense in which the habitus is a "structured structure” and how the intersection of field and internalized dispositions in habitus is in fact the meeting point of two ontologically distinct but mutually constitutive structural orders (objective and internalized) and not the point at which

由于通常将”结构”一词与宏观层面的组织结合在一起，惯习很少被视为一种结构，而通常被视为个人或主观意识的替代品，然后面临由其他个人、机构和组织组成的宏观层面的结构(King，2000)。然而，如果我们恢复皮亚杰的心理(认知)结构的概念(皮亚杰，1970年 a，1970年 b) ，那么我们可以欣赏的意义上，其中的惯习是一个“结构化结构”，以及如何交叉的场和内化处置在惯习实际上是两个本体论上截然不同但相互构成的结构秩序(客观和内化)的交汇点，而不是在哪一点

5 In fact I will argue that Bourdieu,s notion of habitus consists of a sociologized version of Piaget,s views of practical cognition.

布迪厄的“惯习”概念实际上是皮亚杰实践认知观的社会学化版本。

"agency" meets structure. 6 Bourdieu was emphatic on this point. For him, ".. .the most obscure principle of action.lies neither in structures nor in consciousness, but rather in the relation of immediate proximity between objective structures and embodied structures-in habituS (Bourdieu, 1996b, p. 38, emphasis added).

”机构”符合规范。6布迪厄在这一点上态度强调。为了他”。..行动最模糊的原则既不在于结构，也不在于意识，而是在于客观结构和具体结构之间的直接接近关系——见《惯习》(布尔迪厄，1996年 b，第38页，强调补充)。

However, this still leaves open the question: If not from phenomenology, from what source can we trace the substantive content of the notion of the habiuS?

然而，这仍然留下了一个开放的问题: 如果不是从现象学，我们从什么来源可以追踪的实质性内容的概念的 habiuS？

## Habitus 惯习

We can appreciate the influence from cognitive psychology on Bourdieu,s formulation of the practical side of the habitus as a "generative matrix" of dispositions toward action that "makes possible the achievement of infinitely diversified tasks" and through the "analogical transfer of schemes that provides the solution to "similarly shaped problems and which also shows the "mastery of the operations'" required to achieve certain ends. All of this conceptual apparatus, especially the notion of analogical and homological transfer of schemes, the idea of an embodied scheme and the notion of bodily operations upon the world, was developed by Piaget in the context of the study of infant cognition during the 1920s and 1930s, and continued to be fined tuned, modified and developed until his death in 1980.7 The idea of analogical transfers, embodied schemas and bodily operations have specific meanings within Piaget,s system that help illuminate some of the obscurity surrounding the habitus and which allows us to appreciate the subtlety of the concept and its flexibility of application to different areas of study (from the

我们可以理解认知心理学对布尔迪厄关于心理习惯的实践方面的表述的影响，布尔迪厄把心理习惯的实践方面表述为对行为的处理的“生成矩阵”，“使得实现无限多样化的任务成为可能”，并通过“计划的类比转移”为“类似形状的问题提供解决方案，同时也显示了达到某些目的所需的“对操作的掌握”。皮亚杰在20世纪20年代和30年代的婴儿认知研究中发展了所有这些概念，特别是方案的类比转移和同源转移的概念，体现方案的概念和身体在世界上运作的概念，并继续被调整、修改和发展，直到1980年去世

6Thus characterizing Bourdieu as "a thoroughgoing phenomenologist" (i.e. Robbins, 1993) is untenable.

因此，将布迪厄定性为“彻底的现象学家”(即罗宾斯，1993)是站不住脚的。

- 7 In the following, it is not my intention to consider the whole scope of Piaget,s thought and work (which consists of dozens of books and hundreds of articles), a goal that is obviously beyond the scope of a single paper. I will only discuss certain key Piagetian ideas as they relate to Bourdieu,s own thinking. For a more complete overview of the Piagetian oeuvre, see Gainotti (1997), Piaget (1977) and Smith (1997).

    在下面，我不打算考虑皮亚杰的整个思想和作品(包括几十本书和几百篇文章) ，这个目标显然超出了一篇论文的范围。我将只讨论某些关键的皮亚杰主义思想，因为它们与布迪厄自己的思想有关。更完整的皮亚杰全部作品的概述，见 gaenotti (1997) ，Piaget (1977)和 Smith (1997)。


sociology of culture to the sociology of education to political sociology). Further, focusing on the Piagetian influence serves to clarify what Bourdieu meant by the Togic" of practice, leading to the conclusion that Bourdieu thought of the term —logic" in this context in very literal terms, as opposed to using the word simply as a loose metaphor.[6](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark8) [7](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark9) Unfortunately most commentary on the idea of the habitus has concentrated on its classificatory aspect (probably because it is the easiest to trace back to the common sociological and anthropological source represented by Mauss and Durkheim (i.e. the societal origins of the Kantian categories of cognition), and the subsequent —inversion" of this line of thinking in Levi-Strauss' cognitive foundationalism (Maryanski and Turner, 1991), which held that the structures of the universally shared cognitive unconscious were responsible for the (macro)structure of society. The idea of the habitus as —generative" for its part has been primarily discussed in the context of an indirect influence of structural linguistics, especially in the form of Chomsky idea of a universal grammar, on Bourdieu's thinking (see for example Bourdieu, 1990b).

文化社会学教育社会学政治社会学)。此外，关注皮亚杰学派的影响有助于阐明布迪厄所说的“ Togic”实践的含义，从而得出结论: 布迪厄在这一语境中以非常字面化的术语来思考“逻辑”一词，而不是仅仅把这个词用作一个松散的隐喻。6/7不幸的是，大多数关于惯习论的评论都集中在它的分类方面(可能是因为最容易追溯到以莫斯和涂尔干为代表的共同的社会学和人类学渊源(即康德的认知范畴的社会起源) ，以及随后在列维-斯特劳斯的认知基础主义(玛丽安斯基和特纳，1991年)中对这一思路的颠倒，这一思路认为，普遍认知无意识的结构对社会的(宏观)结构负有责任。惯习作为生成语法的观点主要是在结构主义语言学，特别是以乔姆斯基的普遍语法观点对布迪厄思想的间接影响的背景下讨论的(例如布迪厄，1990年 b)。

### THE INTELLECTUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PIAGET 皮亚杰的思想意义

Piaget was one of the most influential figures in the Francophone scientific field during the better part of the 20th century, and therefore the appearance of Piagetian ideas in Bourdieu,s conception of the habitus is not that surprising. His career spanned the genesis, heyday and decline of the structuralist moment (Dosse, 1997), and his writings dealt with a number of disciplines, including physics, philosophy, biology, mathematics, psychology, sociology, anthropology and philosophy (Dosse, 1997: p. 220; Gainotti, 1997; Gruber and Voneche, 1995[1977]; Smith, 1997).9 His essay on structuralism (Piaget, 1971) is one of the most complete and important systematizations of that line of thought (Kitchener, 1991: p. 421-422), where its origins and influence are traced to a variety of scientific fields including the mathematical, physical, biological and social sciences; as structuralism reached its highest point of popularity in France, Piaget, right in the middle of this intellectual turmoil, and was in fact one of its primary exponents (Dosse, 1997), and constant critic and fine-tuner (Piaget, 1970b). He was also one of the few scholars that that rejected the static understanding of structuralism inherited from Saussure and adopted almost wholesale by Levi-Strauss and who preferred instead a notion of structuralism that conceptualized structures as fluid but predictable within certain limits, with a determined sequential origin (hence the appellate—favored by Bourdieu— of genetic) and subject to specifiable conditions that facilitated change and development (Dosse, 1997; p. 175; Piaget, 1977).[8](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark11) In fact Piaget,s notorious dismissal of Chomskyan nativism centered precisely on Chomsky,s inattention to the genesis of linguistic structure and his abandonment of the question of genesis to biology and neurophysiology (Piaget, 1970b).

皮亚杰是20世纪中后期法语科学领域最有影响力的人物之一，因此皮亚杰思想在 Bourdieu 的出现并不令人惊讶。他的职业生涯跨越了结构主义时刻的起源、全盛期和衰落期(Dosse，1997) ，他的著作涉及许多学科，包括物理学、哲学、生物学、数学、心理学、社会学、人类学和哲学(Dosse，1997: p. 220; gaenotti，1997; Gruber and Voneche，1995[1977] ; Smith，1997)。他关于结构主义的文章(皮亚杰，1971年)是这一思路最完整和重要的系统化之一(基奇纳，1991年: 第421-422页) ，其起源和影响可以追溯到各种科学领域，包括数学，物理，生物和社会科学;随着结构主义在法国达到它的最高人气，皮亚杰，正处于这种思想混乱的中间，事实上是它的主要倡导者之一(Dosse，1997) ，不断的批评和优秀的调谐器(皮亚杰，1970b)。他也是为数不多的学者之一，他们拒绝了从 Saussure 继承而来的对结构主义的静态理解，几乎被列维-斯特劳斯全盘接受，而是倾向于结构主义的概念，认为结构是流动的，但在一定的限度内是可预测的，有一个确定的顺序起源(因此布尔迪厄支持的上诉ー遗传学的) ，并受制于促进变化和发展的特定条件(Dosse，1997; p. 175; Piaget，1977)。8事实上，皮亚杰对乔姆斯基本土主义臭名昭著的驳斥恰恰集中在乔姆斯基对语言结构起源的忽视和他对生物学和神经生理学起源问题的抛弃上(皮亚杰，1970年 b)。

The contemporary standard popularization of the figure of Piaget as a developmental psychologist who proposed a static stage theory of infant cognitive development is in fact a staggeringly impoverished image (Kitchener, 1991), as exemplified by his attempted syntheses of physics, biology, psychology, and epistemology in Biology and Knowledge (1971), and his structural psychology and the philosophy of science in Psychogenesis and the History of Science (Piaget and Garcia 1989[1983]). In fact Piaget was a polymath whose writings defied disciplinary lines and who left an indelible mark on both the Anglo-Saxon and continental scientific fields.[9](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark12) While very few people in the social sciences think of Piaget as a contributor to social theory—in contrast to his well established reputation in developmental and cognitive psychological theory—this does not have to do with the fact that Piaget did not issue contributions to social theory, as his aforementioned monograph on structuralism and his recently translated collection of essays, Sociological Studies (Piaget, 1995[1965]), attest (Kitchener, 1981, 1991).[10](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark13)

皮亚杰是一位发展心理学家，他提出了婴儿认知发展的静态阶段理论，这个人物在当代的标准普及实际上是一个极其贫乏的形象(基奇纳，1991年) ，他试图综合物理学、生物学、心理学和认识论，生物学和知识(1971年) ，以及他的结构心理学和 Psychogenesis 的科学哲学和科学史(皮亚杰和加西亚，1989[1983])。事实上，皮亚杰是一位博学者，他的著作无视学科界限，在盎格鲁-撒克逊和欧洲大陆的科学领域都留下了不可磨灭的印记。9尽管社会科学界很少有人认为皮亚杰是社会理论的贡献者ーー与他在发展和认知心理学理论方面的声誉形成鲜明对比ーー但这与皮亚杰没有对社会理论做出贡献这一事实并无关系，正如上述皮亚杰的结构主义专著和他最近翻译的散文集《社会学研究》(皮亚杰，1995[1965]) ，基奇纳，1981,1991。10

### PIAGET’S CONCEPTION OF KNOWLEDGE 皮亚杰的知识观

I now move to briefly discuss Piaget,s conception of knowledge and knowledge acquisition because this is the topic in which his emphasis on practice and active involvement in the world is most clearly appreciated. I intersperse my discussion with passages showing certain commonalities between the conceptions of Bourdieu and Piaget in regard to the habitus.

我现在简要地讨论皮亚杰的知识和获取知识的概念，因为这是他强调实践和积极参与世界的主题，得到了最明确的赞赏。我在我的讨论中穿插了一些段落，这些段落显示了 Bourdieu 和皮亚杰关于习性的概念之间的某些共同点。

According to Piaget (1970a), knowledge primarily consists of cognitive structures that help transform and are in their turn transformed by the environment. For Piaget knowledge is always social, practical, and grounded in action (Gruber and Voneche, 1995, p. 869-870), and never individualistic or purely cognitive in an exclusively representational-symbolic sense.[11](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark15) In this respect Piaget is closer to the connotation of that the term "cognitive" contemporarily possesses in the field of cognitive science and artificial intelligence (Bainbridge, Brent, Carley, Heise, Macy Markovsky and Skovretz, 1994), and incidentally the sense in which Bourdieu uses the term cognitive is closer to this pole. While in the social sciences, cognition is usually counterposed to practical action, in the cognitive sciences the process of cognition involves much more than information processing and representation as this is simply the second stage of a three step process. The first step consists of gathering raw information from the environment in the form of preprocessed perceptual stimuli; the second step involves transforming perceptual stimuli into more abstract representations of the environment, usually referred to as schemata or schemas (most treatment of "cognition" in sociology such as Howard, 1994, and DiMaggio, 1997 focus on this aspect). Schemas are much more useful for the organism than purely sensory stimuli due to the fact that the latter are fleeting and can only survive in a sensory memory system for a relatively short amount of time. Schemata on the other hand, can be temporarily held in a more reliable working memory system, were they can be ultimately transferred to a long term memory store. Schemata are also convenient in that they are more malleable and flexible (and potentially subject to internal transformations) than purely sensory stimuli. Finally the organism responds with an action sequence in order to either transform or respond to the environmental representations constructed from the sensory stimulation. The entire perceptionprocessing-action-generation sequence is thus covered under the term cognitive, not only the symbol-manipulation stage.

根据皮亚杰(1970年)的说法，知识主要由有助于转化的认知结构组成，反过来又由环境转化。因为皮亚杰的知识总是社会的、实用的、基于行动的(Gruber and Voneche，1995，p. 869-870) ，从来没有个人主义或纯粹的认知在一个完全代表性的-象征性的意义。在这方面，皮亚杰更接近术语“认知”的内涵在当代认知科学和人工智能领域(班布里奇，卡雷，海瑟，马尔科夫斯基和布伦特顺便说一句，斯科夫雷茨，1994) ，和布尔迪厄使用术语认知的意义更接近这个极点。在社会科学中，认知通常与实际行动相对立，而在认知科学中，认知过程涉及的远不止信息处理和表征，因为这仅仅是三步过程的第二阶段。第一步包括以预处理感知刺激的形式从环境中收集原始信息; 第二步包括将感知刺激转化为更抽象的环境表征，通常称为图式或图式(社会学中对“认知”的大多数处理，如 Howard，1994年和 DiMaggio，1997年关注这一方面)。图式对机体来说比纯粹的感官刺激更有用，因为后者稍纵即逝，只能在感官记忆系统中存活相对较短的时间。另一方面，图式可以暂时保存在一个更可靠的工作记忆系统中，如果它们最终被转移到长期记忆存储中的话。图式也很方便，因为它们比纯粹的感官刺激更具可塑性和灵活性(并且可能受到内部转换的影响)。最后，生物体以一个动作序列作出反应，以转化或响应由感官刺激所构建的环境表征。因此，整个感知加工-动作-生成序列被涵盖在术语认知之下，而不仅仅是符号操纵阶段。

It is in this sense that cognitive structures are of primary importance in Piaget,s developmental theory. However it is important to keep in mind that Piaget,s primary emphasis was not on cognitive structures as static symbolic representations, but on bodily schemas (a term favored by Bourdieu, but first popularized by Piaget) and the operations generated by way of these, through which the child is then able to transform those representational structures into recognizable plans of action in the world, and to acquire new cognitive structures from the feedback obtained from her practical doings in the surrounding environment. In this sense, Piaget considered knowledge to be of a primarily operative nature, and of cognitive development as dictated by the interplay of different structural systems some bodily-motor, and some symbolic-representational. This emphasis on the dialectic of active operation and cognitive representation, as opposed to a pure emphasis on the passive recording of reality by the subject‘s consciousness connects Piaget with the contemporaneous current of post-Husserlian French phenomenology primarily represented by Merlau-Ponty (2002); however, as we will see below, Bourdieu,s idea of the operation of the habitus was much more directly influenced by Piagetian conceptions.[12](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark16) As Piaget puts it:

正是在这个意义上，认知结构在 Piaget 的发展理论中是最重要的。然而，重要的是要记住，皮亚杰的主要重点不是认知结构作为静态的符号表征，而是身体图式(这一术语受到布迪厄的青睐，但首先由皮亚杰推广)和由此产生的运作，通过这些运作，儿童能够转换这些代表性结构成为世界上可识别的行动计划，并获得新的认知结构从她的实际行为反馈在周围环境。在这个意义上，皮亚杰认为知识主要具有可操作性，认知发展是由不同的结构系统、某些身体运动系统和某些符号表征系统的相互作用决定的。这种对主动操作和心智表征的辩证法的强调，与主体意识对现实的被动记录的纯粹强调相反，将皮亚杰与以梅洛-庞蒂(Merlau-Ponty，2002年)为代表的后胡塞尔时代法国现象学的当代潮流联系了起来; 然而，正如我们将在下面看到的，布迪厄关于惯习操作的思想更直接地受到皮亚杰观念的影响:

To know is to transform reality [through action] in order to understand how a certain state is brought about. By virtue of this point of view, I find myself opposed to the view of knowledge as a copy, a passive copy, of reality. In point of fact, this notion is based on a vicious circle: in order to make a copy we have to know the model we are copying, but according to this theory of knowledge the only way we know the model is by copying it, until we are caught in a circle, unable to know whether our copy of the model is like the model or not.. To my way of thinking, knowing an object does not mean copying it—it means acting upon it. It means constructing systems of transformations that can be carried out on or with this object. Knowing reality means constructing systems of transformations that correspond, more or less adequately, with reality. They are more or less isomorphic to transformations of reality. The transformational structures of which knowledge consists are not copies of the transformations in reality; they are simply possible isomorphic models among which experience can enable us to choose" (Piaget, 1970, p. 15, emphasis added).

了解就是通过行动改变现实，以便理解某种状态是如何产生的。凭借这种观点，我发现自己反对把知识看作是现实的一个复制品，一个被动的复制品。事实上，这个概念是基于一个恶性循环: 为了复制我们必须知道我们正在复制的模型，但是根据这个知识理论，我们知道模型的唯一方法就是复制它，直到我们陷入一个循环，无法知道我们复制的模型是否像模型。.在我看来，了解一个物体并不意味着复制它，而是对它采取行动。它意味着构造可以在该对象上或用该对象进行的转换系统。了解现实意味着构建与现实或多或少相适应的转换系统。它们或多或少地与现实的转换同构。知识所包含的转换结构不是现实中转换的复制品; 它们只是可能的同构模型，其中经验可以使我们作出选择”(皮亚杰，1970年，第15页，强调补充)。

The primary purpose of knowledge accumulation and development is consequently change and transformation as well as the conservation of previously acquired cognitive structures, with cognitive and bodily structures alternating between states of equilibrium and shorter lived episodes of disequilibrium and subsequent re-equilibration, as the child attempts to cope with an ever changing experiential flux. This formulation of a flexible structuralism, is in stark contrast to Levi-Straussian static cognitivism which in Bourdieu,s words simply asserted "...the universality and eternity of the logical categories that govern the "unconscious activity of the mind'" but ignores "...the dialectic of social structures and structured, structuring dispositions through which schemas of thought are formed and transformed' (Bourdieu, 1990a: p. 41, emphasis added). This latter process was precisely the core contribution of Piaget,s constructivist structuralism (Piaget, 1977). For Piaget this capacity to structure while at the same time being able to be structured (a key component of Bourdieu's definition of the habitus) was in fact a general capacity of all structural arrangements. For instance in Structuralism Piaget (1970b:  p. 10) notes that "If the character of structured wholes depends on their laws of

知识积累和发展的主要目的是因此改变和转化，以及保护先前获得的认知结构，认知和身体结构之间的平衡状态和短暂的不平衡期交替和随后的重新平衡，因为儿童试图应付一个不断变化的经验流量。这种灵活结构主义的表述方式，与列维-斯特劳斯的静态认知主义形成了鲜明的对比，后者在 Bourdieu 只是简单地断言“ ... 支配着“心灵的无意识活动”的逻辑范畴的普遍性和永恒性，但忽略了”... 社会结构和结构，结构化倾向，通过这些结构和倾向，思想图式得以形成和转化”(布尔迪厄，1990年: 第41页，强调补充)。这后一个过程正是皮亚杰建构主义结构主义的核心贡献。对皮亚杰来说，这种结构化的能力实际上是所有结构性安排的一般能力，而同时又能够结构化(布迪厄关于习性的定义的一个关键组成部分)。例如，在结构主义皮亚杰(1970年 b: 第10页)注意到，“如果结构整体的性质取决于他们的法律

composition, these laws must of their very nature be structuring: it is the constant duality, or bipolarity, of always being simultaneously structuring and structured that accounts for the success of the notion of law or rule employed by structuralists." In fact it can be argued that Bourdieu's dialectical model of the habitus as both a structured structure and a structuring structure is directly related to Piaget's conceptualization of the process of knowledge acquisition as a dialectic produced both by structured action upon reality that transforms the world, and by the outer environment's subsequent structuring effect on the categorical schemata that we use to make sense of the world (Piaget, 1977). For Piaget (1971; p. 27), "The essential functions of the mind consist in understanding and in inventing, in other words, in building up structures by structuring reality." Further, we can appreciate with more clarity how Bourdieu's notion of the habitus as "mirroring" or as somehow "containing" the field is directly associated with Piaget's more abstract conception of the act of knowing as entailing the construction of systems of (bodily and mental) transformations that are "isomorphic" (but never fully equivalent with) with reality.

这些法则的本质必须是结构化的: 正是持续的二元性，或者说两极性，总是同时结构化和结构化，这解释了结构主义者所使用的法律或规则的概念的成功。”事实上，我们可以认为，布迪厄关于惯习既是结构结构又是结构结构结构的辩证模型，与皮亚杰关于知识获取过程的概念化直接相关，这一过程是由改变世界的现实的结构化行动和外部环境随后对我们用来理解世界的范畴图式的结构化效应所产生的辩证法。对于皮亚杰(1971年; 第27页)来说，“心灵的基本功能在于理解和创造，换句话说，在于通过构建现实来建立结构。”此外，我们可以更清楚地理解布迪厄关于习性的概念是如何作为“镜像”或者以某种方式“包含”场的，与皮亚杰关于认知行为的更抽象的概念直接相关的，这种认知行为包含了与现实“同构”(但从未完全等同)的(身体和精神)转换系统的建构。

It is important to be clear as to what isomorphism means from this perspective. As Hofstadter (1990[1979]: p. 49) notes, in the mathematical context (from which Piaget drew in his interpretation of this concept), "The word "isomorphism5 applies when two complex structures can be mapped onto each other, in such a way that to each part of one structure there is a corresponding part in the other structure, where "corresponding5 means that the two parts play similar roles in their respective structures." As noted above, Bourdieu,s (1988, 1996a, 1996b) primary explanatory schema consists in drawing out the interplay an dialectic of accommodation and discordance between two distinct structural orders (subjective and objective) and when he speaks of how embodied structures are "isomorphic" or "homologous" to objective structures (Bourdieu, 1984; p. 466-468; 1996b, p. 1-6), he is drawing on this mathematical notion of correspondence (Durkheim of course, if famous for proposing the original but cruder version of this mapping between mind and society). It is in this sense that Bourdieu thinks of the "...logic of scheme transfer which makes each technique of the body a kind of pars totalis [whole in the parts], predisposed to function in accordance with the fallacy pars pro toto [parts before the whole] and hence to recall the whole system to which it belongs, gives a general scope to the apparently most circumscribed and circumstantial observances" (Bourdieu, 1990:   p. 69,

从这个角度来看，明确同构的含义是很重要的。正如霍夫施塔特(1990[1979] : 第49页)所指出的，在数学语境中(皮亚杰在解释这一概念时借鉴了这一语境) ，“同构这个词适用于两个复杂结构可以相互映射的情况，这种映射方式使得一个结构的每个部分在另一个结构中有相应的部分，其中“对应”意味着两个部分在各自的结构中发挥相似的作用如上所述，布迪厄(1988年，1996年 a，1996年 b)的主要解释性图式在于勾勒出两个不同结构秩序(主观和客观)之间调节和不协调的相互作用的辩证法，当他谈到具身结构如何与客观结构“同构”或“同源”时(布迪厄，1984年; 第466-468页; 1996年 b，第1-6页) ，他引用了这种数学上的对应概念(杜尔海姆当然是因为提出了这种思想与社会之间映射的原始但粗糙的版本而著名)。正是在这个意义上，布尔迪厄认为“ ... ... 方案转移的逻辑使身体的每一种技术成为一种总和[部分的整体] ，预先倾向于按照谬误部分[部分在整体之前]运作，因此回顾它所属于的整个系统，给予最明显的限制和间接的观察一个一般的范围”(布尔迪厄，1990年: 第69页,

emphasis added). Thus the usage of the term isomorphic here does not refer to producing a "carbon copy" of the external world (field) that is marked in the individual mind (as in the traditional social learning model), but in the development of a set of flexible and transposable procedures, bodily and mental transformations, that are simultaneously a model for as well as a model of reality, and which imply and correspond to that reality (Piaget, 1970a). It is also in this sense of the mutual correspondence (not Newtonian determination) between objective and internalized structures that the concept of structural homology often deployed by Bourdieu should be interpreted. For instance in the context of discussing the association between the patterns of classification used by judges to judge the intellectual merits of essays written by students in a prestigious competition, and the disciplines of study and class backgrounds of those students, Bourdieu (1996b, p. 29) notes that:

强调添加)。因此，这里同构一词的用法并不是指产生在个人头脑中标记的外部世界(领域)的”复制品”(如传统的社会学习模式) ，而是指发展一套灵活和可转换的程序，即身体和心理的转变，它们既是现实的模式，又是现实的模式，并且暗示和符合这一现实(Piaget，1970年 a)。也正是在这种客观结构和内化结构之间的相互对应(而不是牛顿的决定)的意义上，布迪厄经常使用的结构同源性概念才应该得到解释。例如，在讨论评委用于评判学生在著名竞赛中所写论文的智力价值的分类模式与这些学生的学科和阶级背景之间的联系时，布迪厄(1996年 b，第29页)指出:

The harmony between the properties objectively linked to the different positions in the objective structures and the social and academic properties of the corresponding students and teachers is grounded in the seemingly inextricably dialectic that obtains between the mental structures and the objective structures of the institution. While we should bear in mind, in opposition to a certain mechanistic view of action, that social agents construct social reality, both individually and collectively, we must take care not to forget...that the have not constructed the categories that they implement in this construction. The subjective structures of the unconscious that carries out the acts of construction, of which academic evaluations are but one example among many, are the product of a long, slow unconscious process of the incorporation of objective structures.

客观上与客观结构中的不同位置以及相应的学生和教师的社会和学术性质相联系的性质之间的和谐，是建立在看似不可分割的辩证法之上的，这种辩证法在制度的心理结构和客观结构之间得到了体现。虽然我们应该牢记，反对某种机械的行动观点，社会行动者建构社会现实，包括个人和集体，我们必须注意不要忘记... ... 他们没有建构他们在这个建构中实施的分类。无意识的主观结构进行建构的行为，其中学术评价只是众多例子中的一个，是一个漫长、缓慢的无意识过程的产物，这个过程是客观结构的合并。

In this respect it is important to note that in contrast to Piaget, for Bourdieu, the external reality confronted by the agent, is not the abstract "environment" sometimes postulated by Piaget, but is composed of more specific, differentially and socially distributed environments (composed of interconnected and differentially valued material, cultural and symbolic resources). These socially differentiated environments are organized both synchronically as a hierarchical topology of possibilities, homologies and oppositions (which Bourdieu usually represented using the statistical tool of "the analysis of correspondences") and diachronically as an ordered trajectory of encounters with similarly structured realities (i.e. the progression from middle school to high school and university in modern societies), themselves produced and shaped by the organized action of a myriad of other agents generating action according to their own intersection with this structured reality (Bourdieu, 1988, p. 149). Bourdieu,s (1984) entire notion of class based taste as producing differentially valued bodily and mental capacities to consume certain objects is dependent on this notion of the external environment as being encoded in bodily practices.

在这方面，必须指出，与皮亚杰不同的是，对布迪厄而言，行为者所面对的外部现实并不是皮亚杰有时假定的抽象”环境”，而是由更具体、差异和社会分布的环境(由相互关联和有差异价值的物质、文化和符号资源组成)组成。这些社会差异化的环境既是以可能性、同源性和对立性的层次拓扑结构同步组织起来的(布尔迪厄通常使用”通信分析”的统计工具来表示) ，也是以历时性的方式组织起来的与同样结构的现实相遇的有序轨迹(即从中学到现代社会中的高中和大学的发展) ，它们本身是由无数其他因素的有组织行动产生和塑造的，这些因素根据它们自己与这一结构化的现实的交集而产生行动(布尔迪厄，1988年，第149页)。布迪厄(1984)的整个基于阶级的口味的概念，作为产生不同价值的身体和心理能力消费某些物体是依赖于这个概念的外部环境作为编码在身体实践。

### ASSIMILATION AND ACCOMMODATION 同化与顺应

Piaget distinguished two kinds of cognitive structures: action schemes, which are practical (bodily) way of accomplishing some task or bring a state of affairs into effect in the external world, and logical structures, which are various ways of organizing and ordering categorical information about objects in the world, such as taxonomies and hierarchical classification systems. This is as close as he came to codifying the symbolic/practical distinction in his system. Bourdieu would later on collapse both of these functions (in addition to perception), classificatory and action-generative, into his conceptualization of the habitus. Recall in this context that one of Bourdieu,s early conceptualizations (1968: p. xx) spoke of the habitus as a matrix of "perceptions, appreciations [classification] and action". For Piaget the dialectical process of interaction between the individual and the environment is primarily governed by the preexisting stocks of knowledge that the person brings into the interaction; this set of accumulated competences, both categorical and procedural, shape the perception of and are in their turn shaped by new environmental stimuli. On the one hand in it is possible to use previously developed representations of the environment and action schemata developed to deal with past experiences in order to deal with newly encountered situations.

皮亚杰区分了两种认知结构: 行动方案和逻辑结构，前者是在外部世界中完成某项任务或实现某种状态的实际(身体)方式，后者是对世界中客体的范畴信息进行组织和排序的各种方式，如分类法和等级分类系统。这是他最接近于在他的系统中编纂符号/实践的区别。布迪厄后来将这两个功能(除了知觉) ，分类和行动生成，崩溃到他的习惯概念化。在这种背景下，回想一下布迪厄早期的概念化(1968: p. xx)中提到的习性是一个“感知、欣赏[分类]和行动”的矩阵。对皮亚杰来说，个人与环境之间相互作用的辩证过程主要是由个人带入相互作用的先前存在的知识库决定的; 这一系列积累的能力，包括范畴能力和程序能力，塑造了对新环境刺激的感知，反过来又塑造了这些能力。一方面，它可以使用先前开发的环境表示和行动图式来处理过去的经验，以便处理新的遇到的情况。

Piaget referred to the process through which action schemas are applied to new situations as assimilation. Through assimilation, the child applies preexisting stocks of knowledge and practical schemas that were developed in a previous context to new environmental stimuli and segments of reality. Thus, while sucking initially arises as an inborn practical schema designed for the procurement of sustenance, the child is able to "generalize" this schema by sucking other things in her surroundings, such as her own hand or other objects. This is the (bodily) origin, for Piaget of "generalization" or the subsumption of a set of different instantiations of reality (i.e. material objects), under a more inclusive category. As we will see below, Bourdieu thought of the "generative schemes of the habituS in a similar way as capable of being applied, "...by simple transfer, to the most dissimilar areas of practice" (Bourdieu, 1984; p.175).

皮亚杰指的是将动作图式应用于新情况的过程，即同化。通过同化，儿童将先前存在的知识和实践图式应用于新的环境刺激和现实的片段。因此，虽然吸吮最初是作为一种天生的为获取食物而设计的实用图式出现的，但儿童能够通过吸吮周围的其他东西来“概括”这种图式，比如她自己的手或其他物体。这就是皮亚杰“概括”的(身体)起源，或者说是一组实在的不同实例(例如物质对象)的包含，在一个更具包容性的范畴之下。正如我们将在下面看到的，布迪厄认为“惯习的生成方案能够以类似的方式被应用,”... 通过简单的转移，到最不相似的实践领域”(布迪厄，1984年; 175页)。

It is also possible that preexisting schemas produced as an effort at representing past environmental states, are modified when faced with sufficiently new and extraneous environmental configurations such that they require a revision of previously formed schemata stored in long-term memory. In this case it is appropriate to say that the extant structures have been accommodated to fit the environment. For Piaget, the child,s cognitive development is driven by a constant process of assimilation of new information and accommodation of preexisting structures to fit recurring but not necessarily identical situations in the material and social world. In the long run, Piaget reasoned that cognitive development tends toward an equilibrium or balance between accommodation and assimilation processes.

还有一种可能是，为了代表过去的环境状态而产生的先前存在的图式，在面对足够新的和不相干的环境配置时被修改，以至于它们需要修改存储在长期记忆中的先前形成的图式。在这种情况下，适当地说，现存的结构已适应环境。在皮亚杰看来，儿童的认知发展是由不断吸收新信息和调节先前存在的结构以适应物质和社会世界中反复出现但不一定完全相同的情况的过程所驱动的。从长远来看，皮亚杰推断认知发展趋向于顺应和同化过程之间的平衡或平衡。

Piaget,s genetic epistemology tried to bridge the gulf between the traditional antipodes of rationalist nativism and empiricist environmentalism by focusing on the dynamic nature of cognitive structures and their recursive relationship to the external world. However Piaget,s chief contribution and primary influence on Bourdieu,s conception of habitus is his emphasis on the tenet that knowledge and all "higher” levels form of symbolic thought (taxonomies, classifications, logical operations) arises from the more concrete and physical level of bodily action and practice, and that it consists primarily of internalized structures, both kinetic and representational, that are isomorphic (i.e. stand in a relation of correspondence with) with reality. While Piaget rendered his theory in a rather general and terse language, Bourdieu sociologizes the concept of internalized operations produced by reality and sees the habitus as the site where these "systems of durable, transposable dispositions” which are both the product and the producers of subsequent objective structures are located. He does this by giving Piaget,s skeleton of abstract reality the flesh of a sociological account of the differential distribution of socially structured realities with which different class fractions are faced. In this manner he provides his conflict theory with cognitive microfoundations that sidestep the problematic of order from shared representations or from domination through ideological manipulation inherited from Durkheim and Marx respectively (Bourdieu, 1994: 14), both of which are dependent on the fallacy of interpreting cognitive structures in a purely representational manner (i.e. contents in the head or abstract symbolic systems).

皮亚杰的发生认识论试图通过关注认知结构的动态性及其与外部世界的递归关系，来弥合传统的理性主义先天论与经验主义环境保护主义之间的鸿沟。然而，皮亚杰对布迪厄的习性概念的主要贡献和主要影响是他强调了这样一个原则，即知识和符号思维的所有“更高”层次的形式(分类、分类、逻辑运算)来源于更具体和物理的身体行为和实践层次，它主要由内在化的结构构成，既有动态的，又有表征的，与现实相同构(即与现实相对应)。虽然皮亚杰用一种相当笼统和简洁的语言阐述了他的理论，布迪厄社会学化了由现实产生的内化操作的概念，并把习惯看作是这些”持久的、可转换的性格系统”的所在地，这些性格系统既是后来客观结构的产物，也是后来客观结构的生产者。他通过给皮亚杰的抽象现实的骨架一个社会学解释的肉体，社会结构现实的不同分布，不同的阶级分数面对。他以这种方式为自己的冲突理论提供了认知微观基础，避开了从共享表征到秩序问题，或者从分别继承自涂尔干和马克思的意识形态操纵到统治的问题(布尔迪厄，1994:14) ，这两者都依赖于以纯粹表征的方式解释认知结构的谬论(即在头脑中的内容或抽象的符号系统)。

### THE CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS: THINKING WITH THE BODY 操作的概念: 用身体思考

I submit that the idea of habitus as a lasting system of transposable dispositions that provides a generative matrix of classificatory and practical competences and automatisms cannot be understood apart from the generalized idea of cognitive operations. Piaget formulated this sense of the term operation in the course of his studies of infant development and cognition, which he borrowed from the formal algebra of group theory and mathematical studies of general classes of mathematical structures (group, order, and topological) as advanced by the "Bourbaki” group of early and mid 20th century French mathematicians who published under this pseudonym (Piaget, 1970b, 1977).[13](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark19)

我认为，除了广义的认知操作概念之外，不能理解惯习作为一个持久的转位性格系统的概念，这个系统提供了一个分类和实际能力以及自动性的生成矩阵。皮亚杰在他研究婴儿发展和认知的过程中阐述了这种术语运算的意义，他借用了群论的正式代数和数学结构(群、序和拓扑)的一般类别的数学研究，这些数学结构是由20世纪早期和中期的法国数学家的“布尔巴基”团队以这个笔名发表的(皮亚杰，1970年，1977年)

For Piaget, action in the world could be understood as similar to mental action performed on cognitive objects under some system of rules (i.e. action performed on the natural numbers under the rules of simple arithmetic). As noted above, Piaget,s elementary contribution consisted on showing how "higher order” mental operations have their foundation on Tower order” motor operations. Thus the mental manipulation of mathematical objects in effect has as its underlying template the physical manipulation of real world objects in the early stages of psycho-motor development. It is in this sense that Piaget (1970b) thought of both mathematical operations (i.e. addition, subtraction), and Boolean and logical operations (i.e. negation, union, intersection) as having as their early substrate the sensorimotor manipulations enacted upon real-world objects (such as for instance, moving an object away from the body is the "negation” of the operation composed by moving it towards the body). That Bourdieu was deeply familiar with this mode of conceptualizing action in the world is evident from an attentive reading of The Logic of Practice. For instance, Bourdieu in arguing that (implicit) belief in legitimized social orders (doxa) has both a cognitive and a bodily foundation puts it this way:

Practical belief is not a 'state of mind', still less a kind of arbitrary adherence to a set of instituted dogmas and doctrines ('beliefs'), but rather a state of the body. Doxa is the relationship of immediate adherence that is established in practice between a habitus and the field to which it is attuned, the pre-verbal taken for granted of the world that flows form practical sense. Enacted belief, instilled by the childhood learning that treats the body as a living memory pad, an automaton that 'leads the mind unconsciously along with it', and as repository for the most precious values, is the form par excellence of the 'blind or symbolic thought'...which Leibniz refers to, thinking initially of algebra, and which is the product of quasi-bodily dispositions, operational schemes, analogous to the rhythm of a line of verse who's words have been forgotten, or the thread of a discourse that is being improvised, transposable procedures, tricks, rules of thumb which generate through transference countless practical metaphors that are probably as devoid of perception and feeling as the algebraist's dull thoughts. Practical sense, social necessity turned into nature, converted into motor schemes and body automatisms, is what causes practices, in and through what makes them obscure to the eyes of the their producer, to be sensible, that is informed by a common sense. It is because agents never know completely what they are doing that what they do has more sense than they know (Bourdieu, 1990a: p. 68-69, italics added).

Here we can discern two principal themes in Bourdieu‘s thinking about the habitus and the origins of practical action: first, belief, both in the sense of subjective harmony and objective coordination between the internal and the external is a bodily phenomenon and second, practical action arises out of the operation of motor and operational schemes stored in the socially produced cognitive [not Freud,s psychodynamic] unconscious, the true repository of collective representations in the Durkheimian sense.[14](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark20) Thus, the key idea borrowed by Bourdieu from Piaget consists of the notion that the body itself can be both the site and the primary source of operations that come to acquire increasing generality and flexibility through experience, but which can also become "locked in" (conserved) through sustained repetition in socially produced action contexts.

The child might begin with a simple set of behavioral responses (i.e. grasping, sucking) that after continual attunement by the environment come to deployed in a wider class of situations, and thus become a generalized bodily schema. For Bourdieu, a constant stream of experiences differentially generated by class position, similarly produce an embodied reflection of those positions in terms of concrete bodily structures. In fact, in Distinction Bourdieu,s mentions Piaget,s work precisely in the context of talking about the pre-reflexive, bodily status of art appreciation, opposing the Kantian view of artistic appreciation as purely cognitive and incorporeal act of judgment:

Art is also a 'bodily thing', and music, the most 'pure‘ and "spiritual5 of all the arts, is perhaps simply the most corporeal...It is pitched not so much beyond words as below them, in gestures and movements of the body, rhythms -which Piaget.says characterize the functions located, like everything which governs taste, at the articulation of the organic and the mental (Bourdieu, 1984; p. 80, italics added).[15](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark21)

In this respect, one of Bourdieu's most creative concepts consists of the bodily habitus as capable of generating —practical metaphors (Bourdieu, 1984; p. 173), "that is to say, transfers (of which the transfer of motor habits is only one example).'' These practical metaphors consist precisely upon bodily operations that are brought to bear by members of different class fractions on the objects they encounter during their everyday life. They serve as metaphors of each other precisely because of the fact "that they are the product of transfers of the same schemes of action from field to another' in the very same way that a rhetorical metaphor is a transfer of meaning from a vehicle to a tenor. Practical metaphors can also be composed of non-human material and ecological orderings, as in Bourdieu's analysis of the peculiar spatial arrangement of the Kabyle household (1990; p. 93) apparently designed to establish a clear opposition between inside and outside, of a set of quasi-mathematical operations such as a ".semi-rotation, but only on the condition that the language of mathematics is brought back to its basis in practice, so that terms like displacement and rotation are given their practical senses as movements of the body..." This is of course one of the central Piagetian insights (Piaget, 1977), in particular the idea of the origins of mathematical and logical reasoning in bodily schemata (Piaget 1924; Piaget and Szeminska 1941).[16](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark22) Bourdieu, utilizes a similar Piagetian framework in his analysis of the role of habiius in Kabile ritual (1990: p. 92) when he compares the logic of ritual procedures and actions to the operations of formal logic. However, in opposition to the standard Levi-Straussian cognitive pan-logicism, which is based on "...treating practical manipulations and bodily movements as logical operations; of speaking of analogies and homologies.when it is simply a matter of practical transfers of incorporated, quasi-postural schemes (emphasis added).

Let us also consider Bourdieu's (1990a:  89) account of bodily generalization. Out it

proper theoretical context, the idea of "bodily generalization" appears nonsensical: how can the body "generalize" when generalization is the prototypical "cognitive" operation, and thus purely conceptual and occurring "inside the head"? This is where familiarity with the Piagetian corpus, helps makes sense of certain claims made by Bourdieu, especially in the more "conceptual" sections of The Logic of Practice. For Bourdieu, the purely symbolic analysis of myth, stories and other linguistic phenomena, especially that which concentrates in purely semantic resemblances, and metaphoric oppositions deployed in ritual practice, or the "...language of overall resemblance and uncertain abstraction" is still "too intellectualist to be able to express a logic that is performed directly in bodily gymnastics" (emphasis added). Thus the "practical schemes" by "inducing and identity of reaction in a diversity of situations" and "impressing the same posture on the body in different contexts", "can produce the equivalent of an act of generalization that cannot be accounted for without recourse to concepts." This is spite of the fact that this "enacted" and "unrepresented" generality "arises...without "thinking the similarity independently of the similar' as Piaget puts it, dispenses with al the operations required by the construction of a concept" (Bourdieu, 1990a, p. 89, emphasis added). Compare this formulation with Piaget's early (1936) notion of "generalizing assimilation" defined as the incorporation of increasingly varied objects into a particular practical schema.

Thus Bourdieu thinks that it is this capacity to "think with the body" and to "know without concepts" (Bourdieu, 1984, p. 471) that accounts for the sense of doxa, or mutual complicity between objective structures and embodied structures, and which accounts for the sense of "belief" and legitimacy of socially produced structural orders. When both the objective and subjective structural orders are in equilibrium, reality and society are seen as unproblematic "givens"; this is the mechanism that —produces belief' (Bourdieu, 1980) in ultimately arbitrary objective structural arrangements. It is this possibility that two ontologically distinct structural orders come to state of temporary equilibrium, which is for Bourdieu the mechanism which produces the reality of society, or the tacit "taken-for-grantedness" of the social world (Berger and Luckmann, 1967); a reality ultimately based on (socially forgotten) initial imposition of arbitrary hierarchies of value (symbolic violence). When these two structural orders come out of phase however, as when the system of Grandes Ecoles in France could not produce as many positions as those which were demanded given the expectations produced by the habitus of a certain fraction of the student population (Bourdieu, 1988), then sudden calls for transformation and questioning of the existing order can be produced; however these do not stem from the metaphysical well-spring of "agency" but are produced by the same system of embodied structures that would have resulted in unproblematic accommodation had the objective structures remained in line with the subjective structures.

Taking the above into consideration, the contention that Bourdieu,s brand of structuralism is the "opposite" of the Levi-Straussian and Piagetian branch because the former deals with social structures while the latter is more concerned with cognitive structures一as proposed by Lucich, 1991--is simply not accurate. Bourdieu,s social theory can in fact be interpreted as an attempt to integrate these two forms of structuralism (sociological and [socio]psychological). This is the一correct in my view一argument put forth by Wacquant (1996) when he claims for Bourdieu, in order

...to realize itself fully, a generative sociology of the manifold logics of power cannot limit itself to drawing an objectivist topology of distributions of capital. It must encompass within itself this "special psychology5 that Durkheim called for but never delivered. It must, that is, give a full account of the social genesis and implementation of the categories of thought and action through which the participants in the various social worlds under investigation come to perceive and actualize (or not) the potentialities they harbor.such dissection of the practical cognition of individuals is indispensable because social strategies are never determined unilaterally by the objective constraints of the structure any more than they are by the subjective intentions of the agent. Rather, practice is engendered in the mutual solicitation of position and disposition, in the now-harmoniou s, nowdiscordant, encounter between social structures and mental structures, history objectified as fields and history embodied in the form of this socially patterned matrix of preferences and propensities that constitute habitus (Wacquant, 1996, p.

XVI).[17](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark23)

### THE HABITUS AND DETERMINISM

Bourdieu,s stress on the habitus' context transposability, experience integration and problem solving functions, stemmed from a fruitful engagement with Piaget,s conceptions of cognitive operations and the latter,s post-Kantian stance on the relation between mind and experience (Piaget, 1971a, 1970a). Further, and in contradiction to those who see the habitus as an overly deterministic element in Bourdieu,s theory, it is precisely this idea of flexible operations that allows for the habitus to not be tied to any particular content (as in some versions of learning theory) instead, the habitus is an abstract, non-context specific, transposable matrix. Thus, what this entails for those who complain that the habitus implies an over-socialized subject is that the Bourdieuan actor, as opposed to the Parsonian variant, is not necessarily burdened with any content-specific value commitments or imperatives. She is endowed with a much more flexible and creative cognitive-perceptual and behavioral set of schemes, which nevertheless tend to "constitute the body as an analogical operator establishing all sorts of practical equivalences between the different divisions of the social world" (Bourdieu, 1984, p. 475). In Bourdieu,s (1984, p. 466) view, it is a mistake to refer to as internalized "values" what are in fact "the most automatic gestures or the apparently most insignificant techniques of the body."

It is at the level of the deployment of structurally similar sets of practical schemes of classification and perception that collective "representations" reside. If the notion of representation is interpreted in its usual "symbolic" sense (implying some sort of substantial content in the individual,s mind [Parsons, 1937]) then we are back to the Durkheimian problematic of having to postulate universally shared contents in some sort of collective mind (Swidler, 2000); however if what is shared is instead socially distributed sets of bodily operations, which working on the different contents afforded by the specific social environment produce countless acts of practical correspondences, then this dilemma is averted. Further, the notion of symbolic conflict over the contents of cultural classification systems can be introduced even when acknowledging that the participants in these conflicts bring with them similar practical competences and classifiable judgments and actions, which "maybe the product of the same scheme of perception...while still being subject to antagonistic uses" (Bourdieu, 1984, p. 480), by members of different fractions of the dominant classes.

It is important to notice that the notion of a transposable matrix both set limits at the same time that it implies flexibility. Epistemologically, a cognitive-perceptual matrix will always be a filter through which the subject will order the flux of everyday experience, and as such it will be constraining. Further, insofar as it will delimit the parameters of practice it will be restrictive (just in the same way that adult monolingual speakers of English have difficulty picking up a second language without displaying an accent, or people with less than a high school degree have trouble noticing what is so great about Bach,s Brandenburg Concerto) Thus as Bourdieu puts it:

The habitus is necessity internalized and converted into a disposition that generates meaningful practices and meaning-giving perceptions; it is a general, transposable disposition which carries out a systematic, universal application一 beyond the limits of what has been directly learnt一of the necessity inherent in the learning conditions.

I am not claiming that some of Bourdieu,s own deployments of the idea of habitus are not deterministic and somewhat reductive一they sometimes are (see King, 2000; Mohr, 2004, and Sawyer, 1999 for examples)一but what I am claiming is that there is nothing inherently faulty or intrinsically deterministic in the concept of habitus that precludes its usage and application in non-deterministic ways. However, this depends on the notion of determinism that is at stake. If by determinism we mean, any attempt to subject social action to explanatory schemes, then Bourdieu,s notion of habitus is guilty as charged. But if we restrict the meaning of determinism to its most classical sense, as an attribute of a theoretical scheme which purports to predict the way that individuals will behave in any given situation (i.e. Skinnerian behaviorism in psychology, or expected utility theory in economics) then the habitus is far for deterministic and in fact allows for a wide range of creative and purposive actions. In fact, a lot of Bourdieu,s critics focus on those aspects of his work where the habitus idea is applied more forcefully as a reproductive force but ignore the instances when it is used in a much more flexible way (i.e. Bourdieu, 1988; 1996a; 1996b). Of course, from a phenomenological or processual perspective no amount of flexibility in the habitus concept itself is going to be acceptable, insofar as it remains an inherently objective structure (Ciccourel, 1993; p. 103; Throop and Murphy, 2002). However, as Ciccourel acknowledges, it is precisely Bourdieu,s adaptation of —genetic structuralism" (an idea also deployed by Piaget since the beginning of his studies on childhood development [Piaget, 1977]) that allows it to embrace "the social genesis of abstract mental structures of schemes of perception, thought and action which are constitutive of habitus”

In sum, we can say that in analogy to Camic,s (1986) account of the resistance of American sociologists to the concept of habit due to its association with late 19th century and early 20th century psychological thought, the reticence shown by Anglophone sociologists to engage the cognitive side of Bourdieu,s theory while accepting its conflict and macrostructuralist facets, evinces a selective appropriation of Bourdieu, one in line with what have been the traditional concerns of (especially) American sociological research, and its antagonistic relation to anything associated with psychology.[18](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#bookmark25) In this sense the under-emphasis or hasty rejection as "reductionist" of the reproductive side of Bourdieu,s social thought can be seen to stem not from some inherent intellectual deficiency in the concept of habitus itself, but from a clash of intellectual traditions and theoretical cultures: French structural-cognitivist (i.e. Levi-Straus, 1962) versus American structural -relational (Maryanski and Turner, 1991).

Conclusion

I have attempted to trace the lineage of the notion of habitus while focusing on its conceptual debt to Cognitive Psychology, especially the constructivist psychological structuralism of Jean Piaget. This detour sheds light on the somewhat clouded origins of the habitus; origins that were left obscure by Bourdieu himself in his written works (save for some scattered references to Aristotle and Chomsky). Viewing the habitus as Bourdieu,s version of a socially produced cognitive structure, composed of systems of bodily operations that generate practical action in the world, sheds light of some of the most unclear and (for this reason) neglected parts of his social theory. An important implication is that Bourdieu,s sociology is through and through a cognitive sociology, and in fact none of his major works (i.e. 1984, 1988, 1996b) can be interpreted outside of this cognitive context. In this sense Bourdieu,s work was discerning in that he anticipated by more than two decades the current concern to develop a sociological study of culture and society that is more in tune to issues related to cognition (DiMaggio, 1997, 2002; Cerulo, 2002; Zerubavel, 1997). However, Bourdieu understood cognition in a much broader sense than current proponents of cognitive theory in sociology (i.e. DiMaggio, 1997; Zerubavel, 1997) and it is this sense of the cognitive that I have aimed to recuperate here.

Ultimately the central problematic of Bourdieu,s social theory was to clarify the process through which objective social structures (macrolevel arrangements of differentially valued material and symbolic resources) are translated in the process of socialization, through the pervasive development of a system of practical correspondences, into embodied social structures (Bourdieu, 1984, p. 467) which in their turn produce practices in tune with the social structures

1999), in addition to anthropologists and sociologists; can an analogous development be imagined in the Anglophone intellectual field?

that generated them and which serve to reproduce and transform those very same objective structures through time.

Thus, one of the reasons that interpreters have had such a difficult time understanding the habitus, is that they conflate the concept of habitus with Bourdieu,s version of the first-person phenomenological perspective (King, 2000), and do not realize that the habitus is itself an objective structure albeit one located at a different ontological level and subject to different laws of functioning than the more traditional "structure" represented by the field. This shift in perspective necessitates that we disabuse ourselves of the idea of Bourdieu as a "structuration" theorist in the vein of Giddens (1984). In this respect, while Giddens and other commentators (i.e. Sewell, 1992) have spoken about the duali^ of stFuctwe, Bourdieu,s is best considered as proposing a duality of structures. This also means that we need to think of two temporalities and ontological orders when considering Bourdieu. One temporality is developmental and manifested in the specific materiality of the human body and the life-course history of dispositions stored in the psycho-motor and cognitive-motivational system (habitus), while the other is historical and manifested as durable objectified institutions and symbolic orders (field). Thus, Bourdieu (1994: 14) is able to speak of the ".. .cognitive structures inscribed in bodies by

both collective history (phylogenesis) and individual history (ontogenesis) and, on the other, the objective structures of the world to which these cognitive structure are applied."

It is in this sense that both fields and members of fields have intersecting and overlapping trajectories, and the specific configuration and characteristics of both habitus and field at a particular point in time will depend on that exact intersection (Wacquant, 1996). In this respect, there are always to different temporal orders in any sociological explanation: one pertaining to the "structural history" of objective structures (fields) and one pertaining to the biography of certain individuals or populations as they are socialized into specific fields at certain points in their structural development.

Bourdieu,s multilevel conception of sociological explanation and his attentiveness to issues of how this style of explanatory analysis can be applied to the interplay between individual bodily and mental structures and macrolevel social structures has so far been underexploited. Most commentary on Bourdieu,s work has concentrated on his alleged economism, reductionism or determinism (i.e. Alexander, 1995; King, 2000; Vanderberghe, 1999), but all

rest on a similar misinterpretation of Bourdieu as an agency-structure theorist, focused on the problematic of consciousness as confronted by structure. While Bourdieu never tired of asserting that his goal was to make the very terms of that debate irrelevant, he never entirely clarified (at least outside of the theoretical sections of his major works) how his approach to practical activity was grounded in a thoroughly different view of the origins of action as the one inherited from the phenomenological tradition. In a similar manner, Bourdieu himself never made sufficiently clear how the foundations of the habitus on a constructivist cognitive psychology put him far away from the unrealistic models of reasoning and decision-making currently dominant in economics (which obviates the charge of economism), which are beginning to be challenged from the cognitive front (i.e. Kahneman and Tversky, 1996), a challenge which is perfectly compatible with Bourdieu,s views on cognition and practical action. While it is not my contention that the totality of Bourdieu,s work is unproblematic or that his is the last word on any of the problems addressed here, he has opened up the possibility of a type of sociological explanation that is at once inter-disciplinary (combining among other disciplines sociology, philosophy, history, psychology and linguistics), rigorous and comprehensive, and which takes sociological theorizing beyond the boundaries traditionally assigned to it.

That there was a relationship of healthy rivalry between Piaget and Levi-Strauss, and that each new about each other's work is not a well known fact, but it has been documented. See the two interviews by Jacques Grinevald entitled "Piaget on Levi-Strauss: An interview with Jean Piaget" and "Levi-Strauss' reaction: An interview with Claude Levi-Strauss" (Grinevald, 1983a, 1983b); see also Gardner (1967).

[2](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote2)

I claim no originality on this point. That the conceptual structure of the habitus owes a lot to Piaget,s cognitive psychology has already been noticed, at least in France (see Schurmans and Bronckart, 1999).

[3](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote3)



As noted by Dianteill (2003: 529-530), Bourdieu (1985b) acknowledges his appropriation of

the habitus idea from the work of art historian Erwin Panofsky, who himself was influenced by the proto-cognitive idea of historical "symbolic forms，formulated by Cassirer. In fact Bourdieu gives his earliest definition (quoted in Dianteill, 2003) of habitus in the "postface，(Bourdieu, 1967b) to his translation of Panofsky,s Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism. "A system of schema [that] constantly orient choices, which, though not deliberate, are nonetheless systematic; which, without being arranged and organized expressly according to an ultimate end, are nonetheless imbued with a sort of 0nality that reveals itself only post festum.， As Dianteill remarks (530), "He defines the ‘‘modus operandi" (habitus) as the very object of sociology itself and it is as such that he intends to undertake its study. It is therefore inside the history of medieval art and philosophy impregnated with Catholicism that the French sociologist finds the model for one of his principal concepts.，As we will see, while the notion of the habitus may have older roots, its substantive content, is in fact more modern.

[4](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote4)

This strand of thinking would become influential in the Anglophone academic field by way of

[5](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote5)

the work of Mary Douglas (1966), Anthony Giddens (1984 and David Bloor (1976).

[6](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote6)

In this respect it is illuminating to consider Piaget's own account of his —central" motivating idea, as early as 1918 (!) as being "...that action itself admits of logic...and that, therefore, logic stems from a sort of spontaneous organization of acts" (Piaget, 1977; p. 120).

[7](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote7)

Piaget is know to have influenced other social and philosophical thinkers including Jurgen Habermas (Kitchener, 1991, p. 434), Thomas Kuhn, from whom the latter drew his notion of discontinuous stages of thought in the history of science (Levine, 2000), and Lucien Goldmann's —genetic structuralism" (Mayrl, 1978; Zimmerman, 1979). However, it is likely that the relationship between Goldmann and Piaget was probably one of mutual influence as both were at the forefront (in the 1950s) of advocating a new type of historical structuralism that went beyond the static appropriations of Saussure's classic formulation (Dosse, 1997: p. 175).

[8](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote8)

In fact Piaget was one of the organizers of a well known conference in Normandy related to the theme of "the confrontation between genesis and structure" (Dosse, 1997: p. 173).

[9](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote9)

A little know fact is that Piaget was the youngest of 62 scholars to be selected by Harvard University during the celebration of their tercentenary in 1936 to receive an honorary degree (Hsueh, 2004). Even more surprising is that he was granted this degree as a sociologist and not a psychologist. The reason for this is, as Hsueh notes (2004: p. 32), because Piaget,s work was little read at the primarily physiology and philosophy oriented department of sociology at

Harvard, but was extremely influential and discussed in education, sociology and other disciplines, including industrial research and human relations. In fact, the now (in)famous Hawthorne Plant studies, were inspired by Piaget,s work and methodology, especially his development of the in-depth clinical interview to analyze the cognitive processes of children (Munari, 1994: 312); and Elton Mayo who organized the studies, was an avid reader of Piaget

(Hsueh, 2004).

[10](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote10)

An exception to this pattern is Fiske (1995; p. 26-30, 124-126) who insightfully connects Piaget,s work on infant reasoning about justice, and morality to Weber,s tripartite typology of authority relations (charismatic, traditional and rational-legal) and Durkheim,s classification of types of social orders (mechanical solidarity vs. organic solidarity) and forms of punishment (retributive vs. restitutive). See also Gainotti (1997), Kitchener (1981, 1991) and Maier (1996) on Piaget,s contributions to sociological thinking.

[11](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote11)

That the late Piaget,s view of mental functioning became more and more idealist and solipsistic, with cognitive structures floating around in disconnected, asocial ether, is a common misconception. Even in a late work like Biology and Knowledge (1971a), Piaget asserts that: "...society is the supreme unit, and the individual can only achieve his inventions and intellectual constructions insofar as he is the sear of collective interactions that are naturally dependent, in level and value, on society as a whole" (Gruber and Voneche, 1995, p. 858).

[12](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote12)

The purpose of this review of Piaget,s thinking is not to show that every "psychological" sounding term used by Bourdieu must have been a direct or indirect borrowing from Piaget. For instance the idea that the origins of "figurative" (i.e. symbolic) schemas have their origins on "postural schemes" (a term preferred by Bourdieu to refer to a critical component of the habitus) developed in during childhood development has its origins in the work of the psychologist Henry Wallon. Piaget (1962) claimed that his notion of sensorimotor schemas was identical to Wallon's.

[13](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote13)

The Bourbaki group included, among others, Mandelbrot, an early developer of fractal geometry (Gleick, 1987), and Andre Weil who wrote the mathematical appendix to Levi-Strauss' Elementary Structures of Kinship (Barbosa de Almeida, 1990).

[14](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote14)

A position similar to that put forth by the Levi-Strauss of the Savage Mind (1966) and The Jealous Potter (1988), where he distinguishes his own rendering of the linguistic unconscious from the Freudian version. However, for Levi-Strauss in contrast to Piaget, the cognitive unconscious is timeless and universal; for Bourdieu (1984, p. 468) in contrast, while "common to all of the agents of society", the "cognitive structures which social agents implement in their practical knowledge of the social world", which "function below the level of consciousness and discourse" are also "historical schemes of perception and appreciation which are the product of the objective division into classes (age groups, genders, social classes)".

[15](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote15)

Folowing this passage, Bourdieu adds a footnote citing the work of Paul Fraisse, a French experimental psychologist know for his work on the psychology of time (Fraisse, 1964), who also co-edited a book with Piaget (Fraisse and Piaget, 1968).

[16](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote16)

"The mathematical operation derives from action, and it therefore follows that the intuitional presentation is not enough. The child itself must act, since the manual operation is necessarily a preparation for the mental one [...]. In all mathematical fields, the qualitative must precede the numerical (Piaget, 1950, p. 79-80)”, quoted in Munari (1994: 314).

[17](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote17)

See also Bourdieu,s prologue to The State Nobility, "Social Structures and Cognitive Structures" (Bourdieu, 1996b, p. 1-6).

[18](file:///F:/book/html/Lizardo,%20Omar_Words.htm#footnote18)

One of the primary reasons why the social sciences in France where less resistant to psychological influences consists precisely on the availability of structuralism as an overarching vocabulary at one point thought to be able to unify all of the human sciences (Dosse, 1997; Levi-Strauss, 1987[1950]; Piaget, 1970b); thus, in contrast to the American fear of psychological reductionism (best exemplified by Parsons' diatribes against behaviorism [Camic, 1986]), the social sciences in the French intellectual field where able, by way of structuralism, to attempt to integrate the psychological sciences on their o^n terms (Levi-Strauss, 1987[1950]). Thus, both cognitive psychology thanks to Piaget and Psychoanalysis thanks to Jacques Lacan, where able to partake in the intellectual network formed by Anthropology, Linguistics and History during the heyday of structuralism (Dosse, 1999). This intellectual legacy survives to this day: consider a recent edited collection that discussed Bourdieu's work (Lahire, 1999, published in French, which included contributions by developmental psychologists (Schurmans and Bronckart,
